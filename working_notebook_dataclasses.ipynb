    "    - e.g. average inflammation over the `40` days (or `min`, `max` .. and so on)\n",
    "    - e.g average statistics per week (we will assume `40` days account for `5` weeks)\n",
    "    - `...` (open to ideas)\n",
    "3. Calculate some statistics on the dataset.\n",
    "    - e.g. min and max inflammation registered overall in the clinical study;\n",
